description: '"In 1892 I was asked by the Harvard Corporation to give a few public
  lectures on psychology to the Cambridge teachers. The talks now printed form the
  substance of that course, which has since then been delivered at various places
  to various teacher-audiences. I have found by experience that what my hearers seem
  least to relish is analytical technicality, and what they most care for is concrete
  practical application. So I have gradually weeded out the former, and left the latter
  unreduced; and, now that I have at last written out the lectures, they contain a
  minimum of what is deemed ''scientific'' in psychology, and are practical and popular
  in the extreme. My main desire has been to make teachers conceive, and if possible,
  reproduce sympathetically in their imagination, the mental life of their pupil as
  the sort of active unity which he/she feels it to be. Readers acquainted with my
  larger books on Psychology will meet much familiar phraseology. The talks to students,
  which conclude the volume, were written in response to invitations to deliver ''addresses''
  to students at women''s colleges. The first one was to the graduating class of the
  Boston Normal School of Gymnastics. Properly, it continues the series of talks to
  teachers. The second and the third address belong together, and continue another
  line of thought"--Pref. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2005 APA, all rights reserved).'
